# NN-DescentAlgorithm

NN-Descent algorithm implemented in C following this paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1963405.1963487. We also used some of the optimizations from this paper (regarding sampling): https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1963405.1963487, random projection trees (for Euclidean metric initialization method), and OpenMP for parallel programming.
